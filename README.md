### ðŸ‘‹  Hi! I'm [Blake](https://blakewilliams.me/), a full-stack developer living in Boston, MA.

- I write a lot of Ruby/Rails code and love it.
- I'm writing more and more Go and it's pretty rad too.
- I help maintain the [View Components](https://github.com/github/view_component) gem.
- I'm a firm believer in starting simple and introducing complexity through iteration.
